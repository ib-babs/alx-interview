## Description

The island of perimeter problem is a common problem in computer science and programming, particularly in the context of the grid-based algorithms. The problem is usually described as follows:

_Given a 2D grid(matrix) of integers where:_
_0 represents water._
_1 represents land._

The task is to calculate the perimeter of the island. An island is a group of connected 1s (land cell) connected horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally). The perimeter is the length of the boundary of the island.

# Concepts Needed:

1.  2D Arrays (Matrices):

    -Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
    -Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

2.  Conditional Logic:

        -Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

3.  Counting Techniques:

    - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

4.  Problem-Solving Strategies:

    -Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

5.  Python Programming:

    -Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
    -Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
